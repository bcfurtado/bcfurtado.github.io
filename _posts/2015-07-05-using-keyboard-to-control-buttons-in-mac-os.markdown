One of the most things I missed when I moved to Mac OS was the fact I didn’t know how select another button in a active dialog using my keyboard. In Windows and Linux / Gnome this feature is enable by default.

I always thought this was not possible in Mac OS. Only recently I discovery you need need enable it in keyboard settings.

To do it, just:

1. System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts
2. And select `All controls` checkbox under `Full Keyboard Access`

Now you can use tab and space to use it.
