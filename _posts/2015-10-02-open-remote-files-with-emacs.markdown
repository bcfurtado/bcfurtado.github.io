Tired to always need learn news IDE’s/text editors and yours shortcuts of severals vendors and have to change between than every time I had change between languages, I opted to start learn emacs.

Emacs is a console text editor. Looks like old fashion and a hipster thing, but I’m enjoying.
Emacs have some nice features and greats plugins ([Magit](http://magit.vc) I’m talking about you! <3).

One of the features I had discovered today was the possibility of access remotes files with my emacs configurations.

To do that, just type:

```
C-x C-f /ssh:user@machine.com:/home/user
```

You can see nice emacs tricks access on [http://emacsroks.com](http://emacsroks.com). EP 13 is a good one!
