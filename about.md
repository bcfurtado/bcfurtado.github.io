I'm a Software Engineer passionate about code and quality with experience developing SAAS applications.

I'm a big believer that software should be done with quality, which includes writing tests, using the best engineering practices, and having a continuous improvement mindset with a high dose of ownership.

Professionally, I have been working with Java and Python, but I have coded in several languages just for fun such as Ruby, PHP, C, C#, and Lisp. I don't believe in better languages or better environments. I believe in choosing the right tools for the right job.

Most recently I have been working extensively with python and javascript.

I have a particular interest in distributed systems, real-time applications, big data, backend applications, and API design.
